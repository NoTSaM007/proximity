# bot-discord-random
Just a thing I've been working on, a bot for Discord. I'm currently hosting my bot on Heroku. Feel free to contact or ask me anything.

Right now, the bot can:
* Play Songs
* Search Images
* Recognize & Classify Images

Environment variables (Config Vars) to configure in Heroku:
* prefix = command prefix for bot (usually it is !)
* token = Your unique Discord API Token
* watson_key = Your unique IBM Watson API key from IBM Cloud
